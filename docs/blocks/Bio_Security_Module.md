This block allows you to whitelist specific players and disallow anyone who isn't whitelisted to enter the TARDIS. 
<br>
This only is functional in the non euclidean TARDIS. 
<br><br>
You can whitelist someone by doing '/tardis security whitelist (player)' and you can blacklist someone by doing '/tardis security blacklist (player)'. 

!!! info
    By default everyone is blacklisted.
