    ![!Crafting for the Coordinate Designator Module](https://imgur.com/8lz3JpR.png){ align=center }

This is a required module for any TARDIS
<br>
It stores the target coordinates and communicates with the interface. 
<br>
The large button toggles between decreasing and increasing values.
<br><br>
If you're looking at it with the button on top the left switch is for the x coordinate
<br>
The middle is for the y coordinate, and the right is for the z coordinate.
