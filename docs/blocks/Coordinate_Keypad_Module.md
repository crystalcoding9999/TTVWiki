This block unlocks dimensional travel.

It also allows you to set the coordinates, dimension and rotation using the '/tardis target set' command.

This also allows you to save and load locations using '/tardis locations save home' and '/tardis locations load home' for example.

    This module only works if you also have the Coordinate Designator Module
