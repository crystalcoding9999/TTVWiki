This block needs to be touching the core in order to have an effect.

You put size upgrades into this and each size upgrade will increase the radius of the proto TARDIS.

This block is not needed in a non euclidean TARDIS as every module will need to be within 16 blocks of the core in order for them to work inside a non euclidean TARDIS.
