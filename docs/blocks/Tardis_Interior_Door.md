    ![!Crafting for the Tardis Interior Door](https://imgur.com/NHycDmc.png){ align=center }

Once you have a non euclidean TARDIS.
<br><br>
you can place as many of these as you want inside the interior. 
<br>
Keep in mind the only entry door will be the one closest to the original door spawn location, however you can put the door(s) wherever you would like. 
<br><br>
You'll notice they're four sided, if you block 3 of the sides then the one that's left unblocked will be the side the player spawns at when entering the TARDIS this way they don't always have to spawn on the east side and you have more freedom of design.
