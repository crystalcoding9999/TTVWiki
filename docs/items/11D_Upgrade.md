Right clicking on the interface of a proto TARDIS will convert it into a non euclidean TARDIS aka makes it bigger on the inside. 
<br>
It will keep all the blocks you placed and they will be transported into your TARDIS dimension. 
<br><br>
Once you have a non euclidean TARDIS you can make use of the exterior scanner and the door blocks as well as make your TARDIS infinitely large in whatever style you can imagine.
