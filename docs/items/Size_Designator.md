    ![!Crafting for the Size Designator](https://imgur.com/r5aC9OP.png){ align=center }

This item allows you to set your size using a system like the worldedit wand. 
<br><br>
You right click on your first position, then on your second position, and then right click on the size manipulator. 
<br>
This will tell the manipulator what blocks you want to take with you. 
<br>
You can sneak and hold right click to see the area that you've selected. 
<br><br>
Keep in mind you still need size upgrades, each size upgrade is equal to 256 blocks so with max size upgrades you can take a 16x16x16 area aka 4096 blocks. 

!!! info
    A new method of teleportation is being worked on that will be much faster, so you can do larger amounts of blocks at once.
