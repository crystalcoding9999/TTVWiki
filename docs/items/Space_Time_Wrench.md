Used to pickup the interface module while storing all of the contained data, you need to use this to pickup your interface as the block is unbreakable by normal methods.

!!! warning
    You need to place the interface module back on the same X, Z coordinates inside a non euclidean other wise the exterior will be unlinked.

    You can freely move it on the Y coordinate
